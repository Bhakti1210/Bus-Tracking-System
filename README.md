# Bus-Tracking-System

This web application is on going project . The layouts for the website are ready while the functionality is still in progress.Starting month of the project was February 2020.
Bus Tracker System allows user to know about the current location of the public transportation(bus) which is using to reach his/her destination.
The system provides most feasible route and the nearest bus approaching him which the user can opt for.
The system estimates the time for the bus to reach the station where user is standing , also the time to reach the destination is estimated priorly.
This helps user to know the time he would reach his destination in and doesnt not have to wait for long on the bus station.
The database keeps record of new and already registered users . According to that the route is selected automatically for the old users.
Checkpoints those are set on a given route helps system for estimation of the time .
This is a small scale project and has got a lot of future scope . 
As a part of college project we have selected only SIngle route two-ways as of now but can be further extended to track transportation of whole city.
